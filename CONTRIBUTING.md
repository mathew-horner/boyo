# Contributing To Boyo

## Commit Messages
Your commit messages should take the following form:

```
<area>: <description of changes>
```

a real example would be:

```
meta: updated CONTRIBUTING.md to show commit message protocol
```

The `area` element should represent the part of the codebase that is most impacted by your changes. This is a bit of an inexact science, but here is a list of areas of impact that you can choose from for your commit messages:
- `all`: Changesets that span across multiple areas of the repository
- `gb`: Code that is related to Gameboy emulation
- `meta`: Changes that impact generic repository files like [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [README.md](README.md), etc.
